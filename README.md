TL;DR
A button on the circuit activates a count down sequence that iterates through a series of lights and finally triggers a relay. Once triggered this relay activates the rocket.

Upload to an arduino, I used an Arduino Uno for this project, and once circuit is created simply press button to activate count down.




That's it, I hope you enjoy the project! Let me know if anything is unclear or doesn't work!
